Max length chain :

You are given N pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number. A pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion. You have to find the longest chain which can be formed from the given set of pairs.
